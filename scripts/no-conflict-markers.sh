# Blocks unresolved merge-conflict markers from being committed or pushed.
#
# This exists because it already happened in the sibling chat-ws-server repo:
# `src/types.ts` reached `main` carrying `<<<<<<< Updated upstream`, so HEAD did
# not compile. The same guard runs here so neither side can repeat it.
#
# Scans the *staged diff* rather than the working tree, so it only fires on
# lines this commit actually introduces, and partial staging can't sneak a
# marker past by leaving it unstaged.
#
# Only `<<<<<<<`, `|||||||` and `>>>>>>>` are matched — deliberately NOT a bare
# `=======`, because seven equals signs are a legitimate Markdown setext
# heading underline and would fire on ordinary docs.
