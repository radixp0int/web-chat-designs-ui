// Where a portalled overlay (today: the citation hover card) is allowed to land.
//
// `createPortal(node, document.body)` is the usual answer and it is wrong here,
// because this library runs in two very different hosts:
//
//   - The demo app, where `<main class="glass">` carries a `backdrop-filter`.
//     That makes it a containing block for `position: fixed` descendants, which
//     in turn lets its own `overflow-hidden` clip them. An overlay has to be
//     rendered outside it. `document.body` is outside it.
//
//   - The embedded widget, which lives in a shadow root whose `<style>` holds
//     the *only* copy of this library's CSS (see widget/mount.tsx). A portal to
//     `document.body` lands outside that tree and renders unstyled.
//
// So the parent is resolved from the anchor rather than assumed, and the layer
// restates its own theme rather than relying on inheriting one (see
// hooks/useOverlayLayer.ts) — brand.css keys every token off a class, so a
// layer that names its theme derives correctly wherever it sits.
