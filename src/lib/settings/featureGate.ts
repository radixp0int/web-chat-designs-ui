 * source is a mark the reader cannot trace back, and Markdown only linkifies
 * `[n]` when sources are present, so the markers degrade to plain text instead

/**
 * Hides switched-off features by stripping the fields that drive them, just
 * before render.
 *
 * This is the whole reason a feature-flag system can sit outside the
 * components: gating happens on the data, so ChatMessage, ThinkingBlock and
 * the rest only ever see a message that genuinely lacks reasoning, tools or
 * sources. Nothing downstream has an `if (flags.x)` in it, which is what keeps
 * a flag added next quarter from touching twenty files.
 *
 * Only assistant messages are touched — none of these fields appear on a user
 * turn — and `error` is never stripped: a failed turn keeps its alert, because
 * that is a recovery path rather than a detail someone would switch off.
 *
 * Returns the SAME array when nothing is off, so a memoized caller does not
 * re-render the transcript on every keystroke elsewhere.
