// What a turn did, and how long it took.
//
// The rule this file follows is that severity picks the placement, not a color.
// A turn that hiccuped and still answered is not the reader's problem, so it
// never gets a badge or a warning tint — it gets a word ("recovered") in the
// same ink as everything else. Nothing about a finished turn should make anyone
// look twice.
//
// Three views of the same trace, kept together because they share the timeline:
//   - Handle  the duration at the right of a finished turn's action row
//   - Panel   that handle's disclosure, holding the timeline
//   - Failure a turn that produced no answer
//
// The Failure view deliberately has no disclosure. When there is no answer to
// read, the timeline is not a detail hiding behind "Details" — it is the only
// content the turn has, so it is shown outright. Callers own the open state for
// the other two, which lets the handle sit at the right edge of a row while the
// panel expands full-width beneath it.
