/**
 * Native WebSocket stream event types for a mock LLM stream.
 *
 * KEEP IN SYNC with chat-ws-server/src/types.ts — this file is a verbatim
 * copy of the wire protocol shared with the mock server.
 *
 * There are two parallel streams of text:
 *   - reasoning: many `thinking` chunks, then one final `thought`
 *   - answer:    many `token` chunks, then one final `summary`
 *
 * `tool` reports a tool call, and `error` reports a failure.
 *
 * Everything here is plain JSON, so it survives JSON.stringify / JSON.parse
 * across the socket without any custom serialization.
