 * The bar that appears once rows are selected.

 * It replaces nothing and pushes the table down rather than floating over it.
 * A bar that overlays the first row hides the thing you just selected, and on
 * a short result set that is most of what is on screen.
 *
 * The count is the first thing in it because "apply to 2" and "apply to 1,284"
 * are different decisions, and a select-all that quietly spanned every page is
 * exactly where destructive bulk actions go wrong.
