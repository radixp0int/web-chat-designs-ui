        markdown: `## How large should an emergency fund be?

The classic guidance is **three to six months of essential expenses**, but the right number depends on income stability, household structure, and insurance coverage.

### Sizing by situation

| Situation | Suggested months | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Dual income, stable jobs | **3** | Two paychecks cushion a single job loss |
| Single income, stable job | **4–5** | No second earner to absorb a gap |
| Variable / gig income | **6–9** | Income itself is the risk |
| Small-business owner | **9–12** | Personal and business risk are correlated |

> An emergency fund is insurance, not an investment. Judge it by how well it lets you sleep, not by its yield.

### What counts as "essential expenses"

- Housing (rent or mortgage, insurance, property tax)
- Utilities and groceries
- Insurance premiums and minimum debt payments
- Transportation to work

Discretionary spending — travel, dining out, subscriptions — is excluded, which is why the target is usually **60–75%** of normal monthly spending.`,

A comparison of widely available high-yield savings accounts as of Q2 2026. APYs move with the federal funds rate — treat these as a snapshot, not a promise.

| Provider | APY | Monthly fee | Minimum balance | FDIC insured | Transfer limit | Notes |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Meridian Direct | **4.35%** | $0 | $0 | Yes | 6/month | Rate drops to 0.25% above \`$250k\` |

| Harborline Bank | 4.10% | $5 | $1,000 | Yes | 6/month | Fee waived with \`$2,500\` balance |
| Foxglove Financial | **4.50%** | $0 | $0 | Yes | 6/month | Promo rate, reverts after 6 months |

| Atlas Savings Co. | 4.25% | $0 | $0 | No* | Unlimited | *NCUA insured (credit union) |

### Reading the table

- **Promo rates** (like Foxglove's) are fine for parking cash short-term, but compare the *reversion* rate before committing.
- The federal **6 transfers/month** convention survives at many banks even though the underlying regulation was relaxed.
- Insurance cap is **$250,000 per depositor, per institution** — split larger balances across providers.`,

        title: 'Why Automation Beats Willpower',
        markdown: `## The case for automatic transfers

Behavioral studies consistently find that *defaults dominate decisions*: money moved before it reaches the spending account gets saved at 2–3× the rate of money saved "when there's some left over."

### A minimal setup

\`\`\`text
payday (1st, 15th)
  ├─ 60%  → checking        (fixed costs + spending)
  ├─ 25%  → high-yield      (emergency fund, then goals)
  └─ 15%  → retirement      (401k / IRA, pre-tax first)
\`\`\`

1. Schedule the transfer for the **morning after payday** so it never competes with weekend spending.
2. Start smaller than feels ambitious — a transfer you never pause beats one you keep editing.
3. Increase the amount by 1% of income every quarter; the change is too small to feel.

        title: 'Income Volatility and Household Buffers',
        markdown: `## Buffers for variable income

Households with variable income face a different problem: the *average* month is fine, but the sequence of months is not. A buffer converts a volatile income stream into a steady personal "salary."

### The two-account pattern

- **Income account** — every payment lands here, nothing is spent from it.
- **Salary account** — a fixed monthly transfer from the income account funds all spending.

The buffer's job is to keep the salary transfer alive through lean months.

### Sizing the buffer

| Coefficient of variation* | Buffer target |
| :--- | ---: |
| Under 15% (mild swings) | 2 months of salary |
| 15–35% (freelance typical) | 4 months |
| Over 35% (seasonal, commission) | 6+ months |

*Standard deviation of monthly income ÷ average monthly income, over the trailing year.

**Bold move that pays off:** during a strong month, top the buffer *first* and only then raise your salary transfer.`,

        title: 'Ordering Savings, Debt, and Investing',
        markdown: `## Where the next dollar goes

A widely used priority order for each marginal dollar of surplus:

1. **Employer match** — contribute enough to capture any 401(k) match; it is an instant 50–100% return.
2. **High-interest debt** — anything above ~8% APR (credit cards first).
3. **Emergency fund** — to your target from the sizing guidelines.
4. **Tax-advantaged investing** — IRA / 401(k) beyond the match.
5. **Taxable investing or mortgage prepayment** — personal preference territory.

### Why debt sits above the fund's *completion* but below its *start*

Keep a small starter buffer (**$1,000–$2,000**) even while attacking debt — without it, every surprise expense goes straight back on the card, undoing the payoff.

- **Checkpoints** on a fixed rhythm, where you adjust the *cadence*, never the target.

### How to use the drift column

- Drift **positive and growing**: your cadence is beating the plan — consider raising the target next cycle, not the transfer.
- Drift **negative two months running**: raise the cadence by the average monthly shortfall.

The average household pays for **12 subscriptions** and can name 8. The audit takes one evening.

### Method

1. Export 90 days of transactions (CSV works fine).
2. Filter for recurring merchants — same amount, monthly rhythm.
3. For each one, ask a single question: *have I used this in the last 60 days?*
4. No → cancel today. Unsure → cancel anyway; re-subscribing takes two minutes.

Internet, insurance, and phone plans are priced for inertia. A single retention call typically recovers **10–25%**.

1. **Open with the ask**: "I'm reviewing my bills and this one is above market — what can you do?"
2. **Name a competitor's number** (have it open in a tab).
3. **Let silence work.** The first offer is rarely the last.
4. **Take the retention offer in writing** — confirmation email or chat transcript.
