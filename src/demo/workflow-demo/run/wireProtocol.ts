/**
 * Wire protocol for the workflow run server.
 *
 * KEEP IN SYNC with workflow-ws-server/src/types.ts — this file is a verbatim
 * copy of it. There is no shared package and no codegen: the two repos are
 * independent checkouts, so a protocol change is two commits. The server's
 * scripts/check-protocol-sync.sh diffs the pair on commit.
 *
 * The names here are deliberately the canvas kit's vocabulary (see
 * ../canvas/types.ts) so the client can pass most fields straight through. Two
 * places where the wire cannot mirror the kit:
 *
 *   - `EdgeSeed.state` is a *function*, so only the rule crosses (`EdgeRule`)
 *     and the client rehydrates it through the kit's `feeds()` / `never`.
 *   - Steps carry `{column, row}` rather than pixels; the client derives x/y in
 *     ../run/layout.ts. `x`/`y` remain available as an escape hatch.
