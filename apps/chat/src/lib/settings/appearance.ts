/**
 * Applies a palette as a `chat-theme-*` class, removing whichever one was

 *
 * Defaults to `<html>` because `body` paints `var(--canvas)`, which resolves
 * at `:root` — a palette scoped to an inner element leaves the page behind it
 * on the old colours. The exception is the embedded widget, whose root IS its
 * own theme scope; pass that element as `target` there.
 *
 * This does not prevent a flash on first load: the class has to be on the
 * element before first paint, which means a small inline script in the
 * document head reading the same storage key. See the recipe in the README.
