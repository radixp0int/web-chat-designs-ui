 * The row of controls under a message.

 * The revealing variant hides with opacity, never `display`, so the row keeps
 * its place in the tab order and the transcript does not jump when a pointer
 * crosses it. It reveals against the whole turn, which must therefore carry
 * `group/turn`, and it is always visible where there is no hover at all.
 *
 * The rule itself lives in `.message-actions` (lib/chat-ui.css), with the
 * reasoning for each of those; the class is here so callers say `reveal`
 * rather than remembering a stylesheet name.
