 * Icon-only ghost button — the recurring control in the chat UI (header actions,

 * string that was previously copy-pasted across half a dozen components.
 *
 * Every variant has a guaranteed minimum target (see `sizeBox`), so prefer this
 * over a hand-rolled `p-*` button even for a tiny glyph: an inline 12px close
 * icon still gets a 32px box.
 *
 * `active` applies the accent tint used by toggle controls (e.g. the like/dislike
 * buttons). Disabled styling is always present but only shows when `disabled` is
 * set, so nav buttons at the ends of a list dim correctly.
